H5P Solfedge - Libraries for ear-training exercises
==========

## About

These H5P libraries have been created to be used in https://sisuloome.e-koolikott.ee/ or similar H5P content systems. 

The software is developed at Georg Ots Tallinna Music School, now Tallinn College of Music and Ballet for project "Digitaalse muusikateooria ja solfedžo õppevara täiustamine ja arendamine"   with the support of European Social Fund (Euroopa Sotsiaalfond).


The aim of these libraries is to provide H5P content types for creating new solfedge (musical ear training)  exercises in following categories:

- degree dictations (in Estonian: *astmediktaadid*)
- harmonic dictations (in Estonian: funktsiooniharjutused)
- musical dictations, one voiced (in Estonian: ühehäälsed meloodilised diktaadid )


Similar exercises, but limited in number,  are realized here: https://otsakool.edu.ee/digisolf/askdictation/degrees

## For Developers

Anyone is free to extend, debug or improve these libraries. Here are some guidelines and hints about the development.

### Setting up H5P development environment

At the moment of writing, it is most convenient and recommended to develop and test these libraries on Drupal 7 content management system (Drupal 8 or 9 do not support H5P development folder that makes work much quicker).

About setting up Drupal 7: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/install

Setting up H5P on Drupal 7: https://h5p.org/documentation/setup/drupal7 

*NB! Make sure that you download H5P module meant for Drupal 7, not 2.0.0-alpha or other later version:* https://www.drupal.org/project/h5p/releases/7.x-1.50
